This software is BETA and not for production use. It's currently just a proof of concept.

This application is written in PHP and intended to create Doctrine1 and Doctrine2 schema files
from MySQL Workbench Files (*.mwb). It is inspired by http://code.google.com/p/mysql-workbench-doctrine-plugin/.

To create models use it as follows. Do not forget to implement a class autoloading mechanism like in
the example.

<?php
$formatter = new MwbExporter_Formatter_Doctrine2_Annotation_Loader();

// parse the mwb file
$mwb = new MwbExporter_Core_Workbench_Document('myDatabaseModel.mwb', $formatter);

echo $mwb->display();
?>

Currently the formatters need further development to work properly and
do not support behaviours by now as the Workbench plugin did.
